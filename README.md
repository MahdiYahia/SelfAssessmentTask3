I used "Fuel Type" as an attribute combustion engines have, "Battery Capacity" as an attribute electric engines have, and both attributes are attributes hybrid engines have.
An abstract method showEngineCharacteristics() was declared in class "Engine" and implemented in its subclasses to adapt to the different attributes of each engine type. 

The Manufacture class has two attributes names and country.

In addition to classes required by the task, a class Main was written to create the required array of vehicles and check the results of the ShowCharacteristics() method.
